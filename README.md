# read-table-data-as-Image-PyTorch
This project Illustrates how tabular data can be converted to an 2D NumPy arrays to feed to 2-dimensional convolutional neural network in PyTorch.

# Introduction
Convolutional neural networks is one of the most powerful deterministic architecture used for predictive classification and regression machine learning problems. 2-dimensional CNN is widely used for learning from image dataset. There are many deep learning frameworks that provide CNN modeling. Although Keras and TensorFlow are widely used frameworks but they are old. PyTorch is the new member and widely gaining popularity in DL community. PyTorch is relatively faster and more flexible to use. However, one of the most searched question on google is how to pass customed images or tabular data as an image to CNN-2D in PyTorch. While, there are many articles on internet hardly any of them provides complete explaination and steps to link data in the table to the PyTorch model. The information is scattered into several articles. In this article, I have shared complete code that can solve the problem at hand for tabular data to an image. CNN-1D works fairly on most of the HAR datasets, but current research shows CNN-2D improved the performance and provides better results on HAR dataset. This article will help to convert any tabular or CSV files datasets to image object that can be passed to CNN-2D easily.
